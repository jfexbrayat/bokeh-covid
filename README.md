# bokeh-covid

This repository consists in a notebook that displays several Covid-19 relevant metrics from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for Germany at the district (*Landkreis*) level. 
The notebook runs from top to bottom to fetch geospatial data from the [German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy](https://www.bkg.bund.de), Covid-19 metrics from the [RKI API](https://api.corona-zahlen.org/docs/) in an interactive map using the [interactive plotting tool bokeh](https://bokeh.org/).
The notebook was developed using Google Colaboratory and is runnable by following the link at its top.
